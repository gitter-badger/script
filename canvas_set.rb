# Description: Canvas Set class

## Example
# require 'set'
# s1 = Set.new [1, 2] ## -> #<Set: {1, 2}>
# s2 = [1, 2].to_set  ## -> #<Set: {1, 2}>
# s1 == s2            ## -> true
# s1.add("foo")       ## -> #<Set: {1, 2, "foo"}>
# s1.merge([2, 6])    ## -> #<Set: {1, 2, "foo", 6}>
# s1.subset? s2       ## -> false
# s2.subset? s1       ## -> true

## Class notes
# Set implements a collection of unordered values with no duplicates.
#
# This is a hybrid of Array's intuitive inter-operation facilities and Hash's lookup.
# Set is easy to use with Enumerable objects (implementing each).
# Most of the initializer methods and binary operators accept generic
# Enumerable objects besides sets and arrays. An Enumerable object can be
# converted to Set using the to_set method.
# Set uses Hash as storage, so you must note the following points:
#     Equality of elements is determined according to Object#eql? and Object#hash.
#     Set assumes that the identity of each element does not change while
#       it is stored. Modifying an element of a set will render the set to an
#       unreliable state.
#     When a string is to be stored, a frozen copy of the string is stored
#       instead unless the original string is already frozen.

## Comparison operator
# The comparison operators <, >, <= and >= are implemented as shorthand
# for the {proper_,}{subset?,superset?} methods. However, the <=> operator
# is intentionally left out because not every pair of sets is comparable.
# ({x,y} vs. {x,z} for example)
